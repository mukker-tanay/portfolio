To enable the music player, please place your MP3 files in this directory.

The default configuration expects the following files:
1. "Blinding Lights.mp3"
2. "Summer of 69 (Classic Version).mp3"
3. "night-drive.mp3"

If you add different files, please update the TRACKS array in `frontend/components/VinylPlayer.tsx` to match your filenames.
